# ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III

Collection of files for Kaggle competition by ASHRAE. The objective was stated in the competition info as:

*In this competition, youâ€™ll develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.*

The folder `notebooks` contains the kernels used on Kaggle, while the remaining folders contain a version of the pipeline in .py scripts to be run either locally or remotely.
